## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Open a Public Issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Use GitHub Security Advisories
The preferred way to report security vulnerabilities is through GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/hc0830/opensearch-face-recognition/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with detailed information

### 3. Alternative Contact Methods
If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, you can:
- Email the maintainers directly (contact information in README)
- Create a private issue (if you have repository access)

### 4. Information to Include
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected?
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred timeline for public disclosure

## Security Response Process

### 1. Acknowledgment
We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

### 2. Investigation
Our security team will investigate the issue and determine:
- Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Required fixes

### 3. Fix Development
We will work on developing a fix:
- Critical: Within 7 days
- High: Within 14 days
- Medium: Within 30 days
- Low: Next regular release

### 4. Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will work with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will publish a security advisory after the fix is released

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your deployment up to date with the latest version
- Follow AWS security best practices
- Use strong IAM policies with least privilege
- Enable CloudTrail logging
- Monitor your AWS resources for unusual activity
- Use VPC endpoints where possible
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit

### For Contributors
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep dependencies updated

## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Infrastructure Security
- **VPC Isolation**: Resources deployed in private subnets
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for all components
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Network Security**: Security groups with minimal required access
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated
- **Authentication**: API Gateway authentication required
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access controls
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information

### Data Security
- **Image Storage**: Secure S3 bucket configuration
- **Vector Storage**: OpenSearch security features enabled
- **Metadata Protection**: DynamoDB encryption enabled
- **Access Logging**: All data access is logged

## Compliance

This project is designed to help meet various compliance requirements:

- **GDPR**: Data processing and retention controls
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and monitoring
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (when properly configured)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data security (for applicable use cases)

## Security Audits

We recommend regular security audits:
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed for security implications
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Infrastructure Reviews**: Regular AWS security assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- Use GitHub Security Advisories for vulnerabilities
- Create a regular issue for security feature requests
- Check our documentation for security configuration guidance

## Updates

This security policy may be updated from time to time. Please check back regularly for the latest information.
